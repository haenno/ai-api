# django-base-install

The contents of this folder are based on my own notes <https://github.com/haenno/public-krams/blob/main/django-rest-notes.md> and the experience I made while developing a browser RPG adventureÂ for a previous exam <https://github.com/tstsrv-de/rpg>.

## Usage

1. Install Python and pipenv.
2. Install necessary packages by running ``pipenv install`` on the terminal in this folder.

## My changes and additions

- Refactored the code to collect all functions in one file.
- Put every line of logic in functions, so that it can be called from a ``main()``-function.
- Added **'argparse'** for parsing arguments given from console calls of the script.
- Upgraded the logging.
